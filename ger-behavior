German corps behavior:

- advance (start from brux => meaux)
- pursuit the french: if any corp a french corp w/i x radius => pursue: shortest path to where french is => the what: if w/i some rad y < x => attack
otherwise just move down t
- rate of loss of supply: (ammunination only for now => only loss during battle)
- resupply based on how close the corp is to the rail head => take into acct rate of resupply
